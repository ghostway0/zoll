TOOL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You have access to the following tools to help solve problems:

{tool_descriptions}

For each step:
1. Think through your reasoning inside <reasoning> tags
2. If needed, use a tool by writing a JSON command inside <tool> tags with:
   - "name": the tool to use
   - "args": the arguments for the tool
3. You will see the tool's output inside <result> tags
4. Continue until you can give the final answer inside <answer> tags

Tools expect specific JSON input formats. Follow the examples carefully.
Do not make up tools or arguments that aren't listed.
